### Course Goals

Topics will include lectures on the concepts of secure, distributed and parallel computing, and how these concepts are applied while developing contemporary software. Upon completion of the course, students would be able to
- Solve simple programming problems based on various approaches to computer security and information management.
- Build small scale real word applications that incorporate the principles of secure computing.
- Apply parallel and distributed computing to computational problems and analyze the scalability and efficiency of the solutions. 
- Apply Python towards several contemporary programming requirements and techniques involving secure, distributed and parallel computing.
 

### Prerequisites
- This course is an advanced course. Students are expected to be competent with the programming material that is taught in COP4530 (Data Structures, Algorithms and Generic Programming).
- All students taking COP 4521 are required to have previously taken and passed (with a C- or higher final grade) COP 4530  or an equivalent course.

### Textbook
- python-in-a-nutshell-3rd-edition
- Information Security: Principles and Practice 2nd Edition by Mark Stamp (Wiley)
- Topics in Parallel and Distributed Computing: Introducing Concurrency in Undergraduate Courses by Prasad, Gupta, Rosenberg, Sussman and Weems (Morgan Kauffman)

### Assignments, Projects and Tests
- Assignments will be given periodically through the semester. They will be posted on the course website. Students will have a week to 10 days to complete these assignments. 
- There will be two tests over the course of the term. The tentative date for the midterm is the second class period of Week 8. The final will be on the scheduled day and time during Final Exams Week.

### Grading Policy
The final course grade will be computed as follows:


|Tasks| Scores|
|---| ---|
|Class partition| 10 |
|Assignments| 50 |
|Midterm Exam| 10 |
|Final Exam|35|

### Late Assignment Policy
Students are expected to turn their assignments in on or before the due date. Late assignments will suffer a 10 percentage point penalty for the first 24 hour period. For example, an assignment worth 200 points turned in late will receive a 20 point penalty. Assignments turned in more than a day after the due date will receive a grade of 0, but you can still have it graded and receive feedback.

### Academic Honor Code
The Florida State University Academic Honor Policy outlines the University's expectations for the integrity of students? academic work, the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those expectations, and the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty members throughout the process.  Students are responsible for reading the Academic Honor Policy and for living up to their pledge to ". . . be honest and truthful and . . . [to] strive for personal and institutional integrity at Florida  State University." (Florida State University Academic Honor Policy, found at http://dof.fsu.edu/honorpolicy.htm). Assignments/projects/exams are to be done individually, unless specified otherwise. It is a violation of the Academic Honor Code to take credit for the work done by other people. It is also a violation to assist another person in violating the Code (See the FSU Student Handbook for penalties for violations of the Honor Code). The judgment for the violation of the Academic Honor Code will be done by the instructor and a third party member (another faculty member in the Computer Science Department not involved in this course). Once the judgment is made, the case is closed and no arguments from the involved parties will be heard. Examples of cheating behaviors include:

1). Discuss the solution for a homework question.
2). Copy programs for programming assignments.
3). Use and submit existing programs/reports on the world wide web as written assignments.
4). Submit programs/reports/assignments done by a third party, including hired and contracted.
5). Plagiarize sentences/paragraphs from others without giving the appropriate references.
Penalty for violating the Academic Honor Code: A 0 grade for the particular assignment/quiz/exam and a reduction of one letter grade in the final grade for all parties involved for each occurrence. A report will be sent to the department chair for further administrative actions. 
### Accommodation for Disabilities
Students with disabilities needing academic accommodations should: 1) register with and provide documentation to the Student Disability Resource Center (SDRC), and 2) bring a letter to the instructor indicating the need for accommodation and what type. This should be done within the first week of class. This syllabus and other class materials are available in alternative format upon request.
